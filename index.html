<p>This module is is a replacement to the standard <code>coroutine</code>
module that adds <em>tagged</em> coroutines. Functions <code>create</code>
and <code>wrap</code> now receive a <em>tag</em> and a function, instead
of just a function. Function <em>yield</em> now also needs a
tag as the first argument. The tag can be any Lua value.</p>

<p>A yield with a specific tag yields to the dynamically
closest resume of a coroutine with that tag (making
an analogy with exceptions: the coroutine is like
a try/catch block, yield is like a throw,
and the tag is analogous with the type of the exception).
If there is no coroutine with the tag an error is thrown
at the point of the yield.</p>

<p>On a successful yield, any coroutine that has been passed
through in the search for the coroutine that handled that
yield becomes <code>stacked</code>, a new status string returned
by the <code>status</code> function. Attempting to directly resume a
stacked coroutine is an error. Resuming the coroutine that
handled the yield rewinds the whole stack, resuming the
stacked coroutines along the way until reaching and finally
continuing from the point of the original yield.</p>

<p>A failed yield is an expensive operation, so if you are
unsure if you can yield you can use the extended <code>isyieldable</code>
function, which now expects a tag and will return <code>true</code>
only if yielding with this tag will succeed.</p>

<p>A new function <code>call</code> resumes a coroutine as if it had been
<em>wrapped</em> by <code>wrap</code>: any uncaught errors while running the
coroutine will be propagated. But the stack is not unwound:
you can still get a traceback of the full stack of the dead coroutine
(including all of the coroutines that were stacked above it) using
the new <code>traceback</code> function. It is similar to <code>debug.traceback</code>,
except that it includes any stacked coroutines in the traceback.</p>

<p>A new <code>tag</code> function returns the tag of a coroutine. A <code>parent</code>
function returns the coroutine that last resumed a coroutine.
A <code>source</code> function returns, for a given coroutine,
either the coroutine where the last <code>yield</code> came from,
in case of a <code>suspended</code> coroutine, or
where an error originated, in case of a <code>dead</code> coroutine. You can
use these two functions to walk a <code>dead</code> stack of coroutines
with the <code>debug</code> functions in case <code>traceback</code> is not enough.</p>

<p>Finally, the function <code>fortag</code> receives a tag and returns a
set of tagged coroutine functions specialized for that tag.
For compatibility with <a href="https://github.com/saucisson/lua-coronest">lua-coronest</a>
there is also a <code>make</code> function that is like <code>fortag</code> except it
generates a fresh tag if none is given.</p>

<p>Install it by running <code>luarocks make</code> on the provided
rockspec file. The <code>contrib</code> folder has sample libraries
that implement some abstractions on top of coroutines that
can be freely composed with tagged coroutines. The
<code>samples</code> folder has sample scripts that exercise
these higher-level libraries. Some of them depend on
the <a href="https://github.com/mascarenhas/thread">thread</a>
library and on a branch of <a href="https://github.com/mascarenhas/cosmo/tree/taggedcoro">Cosmo</a>
that requires tagged coroutines.</p>
